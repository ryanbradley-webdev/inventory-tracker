## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### What I learned

This project was my first fully-hosted full-stack application with CRUD capability. Learning how to incorporate various hosting platforms' requirements (such as Google for the Node backend) proved to be a challenge, however overcoming these roadblocks provided plenty of learning opportunities.

### Continued development

In future projects I intend to further develop my form validation techniques, as well as developing custom hooks for form components that will autonomously handle validation, submission, errors and loading states.

## Acknowledgments

This project would not have been possible without the support of the Stack Overflow community for finding and solving several issues that I ran into along the way.

Additional libraries I used which drastically helped me develop this application:

- [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
